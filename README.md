# CDMfinalproject

Welcome to my final project

For my final project, I hope to create an album of soundtracks. My vision for these soundtracks is to represent different times and areas at Pitt's campus. My insipiration for this idea came from playing video games, where certain soundtracks would play depending on what area you were in and the time of day. Here is my prospective list of soundtracks for the album:

Soundtracks of Pitt:

1. Mornings in Oakland

2. Forbes Avenue

3. Sennott Square

4. William Pitt Union - Day

5. William Pitt Union - Night

6. Walking in Schenley Park 

7. South O - Saturday Night



Baseline Goals:
-Produce 3-5 tracks
-Include up to 3 instruments per track
-Use at least 10 unique instruments
-Give all tracks a name
-Upload the Garageband files as well as .mp3 versions

Aspirational Goals:
-Produce 5+ tracks
-Use 5+ instruments per track
-Use mixing to make tracks sound crisp/cleaner
-Tracks are pleasing to listen to, fit with the track's name
-Design Album Cover with GIMP
-Post on soundcloud
